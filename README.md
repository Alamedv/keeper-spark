# Keeper Spark

Brief description of the chosen project + justification
 
The project was custom-built with the help of an AI using the platform lovable.dev, after encountering difficulties configuring outdated projects available on GitHub. The application consists of a website with functionalities such as user login, registration, and task management, including the creation, editing, completion, and deletion of tasks.
Justification for the choice:
This project was chosen due to its practical relevance and because it covers common flows found in real-world applications, such as authentication and CRUD operations. Additionally, it was successfully configured, which made it feasible to carry out the testing process.



A web application for task management, built with the help of AI using the [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) platform.  
The system provides full authentication and task CRUD functionalities, making it ideal for study purposes, QA practice, and test automation.
